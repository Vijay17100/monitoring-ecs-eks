🚀 AWS DevOps Project: Scalable Microservice with ECS Fargate + CI/CD + Monitoring
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a production-grade DevOps pipeline for deploying and managing a containerized Flask microservice on AWS.

It covers:

Containerization with Docker
Deployment on AWS ECS Fargate
Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform
CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (OIDC authentication)
Monitoring & logging with CloudWatch and Prometheus + Grafana
Auto-scaling with Application Load Balancer (ALB) + ECS Service Auto Scaling

ECS writing to CloudWatch logs
Prometheus scraping /metrics and feeding Grafana
GitHub Actions pushing images to ECR and updating ECS
Terraform as the infra provisioning layer
🖥️ Run Locally
Clone repo:
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
Build Docker image:

bash Copy code docker build -t myapp . Run locally:

bash Copy code docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp Test endpoints:

bash Copy code curl http://localhost:5000/health curl http://localhost:5000/metrics ☁️ Terraform Infrastructure Terraform files are located in /infra/terraform.

Provisioned resources:

VPC (subnets, route tables, security groups)

ECR Repository (for storing Docker images)

ECS Cluster (Fargate) with Task Definitions and Services

Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Target Groups + Listeners

IAM Roles (Task Execution Role, OIDC Role for CI/CD)

CloudWatch Log Groups

Usage:

bash Copy code cd infra/terraform terraform init terraform plan terraform apply Destroy resources:

bash Copy code terraform destroy 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) Located in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Pipeline Flow:

Trigger: push/merge to main.

Build Docker image.

Authenticate to AWS via OIDC (no long-lived AWS keys).

Push image to Amazon ECR.

Update ECS Fargate service with new task definition.

Secrets managed in GitHub:

None needed for AWS creds (OIDC is used).

Optional: app-specific secrets in GitHub → Encrypted Secrets.

📊 Monitoring & Alerts 🔹 CloudWatch ECS task logs go to /ecs/myapp.

Check logs:

bash Copy code aws logs tail /ecs/myapp --follow 🔹 Prometheus + Grafana (via EKS, optional) Installed with Helm chart kube-prometheus-stack.

Prometheus scrapes /metrics exposed by the app.

Grafana dashboards visualize CPU, memory, and custom app metrics.

Steps:

Deploy app + Service + ServiceMonitor on EKS.

Port-forward Prometheus:

bash Copy code kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prometheus-prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090 Port-forward Grafana:

bash Copy code kubectl port-forward svc/kube-prometheus-grafana -n monitoring 3000:80 Login to Grafana (admin / password from secret):

bash Copy code kubectl get secret -n monitoring kube-prometheus-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode 🧪 Testing Endpoints Once deployed behind ALB:

bash Copy code curl http:///health curl http:///metrics Local test (via port-forward if using EKS):

bash Copy code kubectl port-forward svc/myservice 8080:80 curl http://localhost:8080/metrics 🧹 Teardown / Cleanup Terraform destroy:

bash Copy code cd infra/terraform terraform destroy Delete ECR images:

bash Copy code aws ecr batch-delete-image
--repository-name myapp
--image-ids imageTag=latest Delete CloudWatch logs:

bash Copy code aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name /ecs/myapp
